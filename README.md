# Money Transfer REST Web UI
![Money Stack](https://github.com/peter-sattler/money-transfer-api/blob/master/img/money-stack.gif)

Design and develop a web project on any subject you wish, providing that the content of the project includes dynamic DHTML effects/behavior, event handling, at least one form with form validation, and cookies or web storage. All back-end related services are provided by my REST API project (https://github.com/peter-sattler/money-transfer-api) which also found here on Github.

Please note that the initial user interface was created as part of the final project for a class I attended at New York University's School of Professional Studies (NYU SPS INFO1-CE9755) during the Summer of 2019. Special thanks to Professor Sam Sultan (http://samsultan.com) for his humor, patience and knowledge of Javascript. I have run across only a few good teachers in my lifetime and you are certainly counted in that group. Thank you.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine. Once the WEB service is running, it will serve all the static content that is needed.

```text
git clone https://github.com/peter-sattler/money-transfer-ui
cd money-transfer-ui
npm start
```

## Implementation Details

:moneybag: Implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript (including AJAX) only  
:moneybag: Static content is served via an embedded Express web server (https://expressjs.com) 
:moneybag: No heavy frameworks are used
