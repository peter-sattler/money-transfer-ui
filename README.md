# Money Transfer Web UI
![Money Stack](https://github.com/peter-sattler/money-transfer-ui/blob/master/public/images/nyu-sps-logo.jpg)

# Background

This web user interface (UI) was created for and submitted as the final project in a JAVASCRIPT - FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT. This course (INFO1-CE9755) was held at New York University's School of Professional Studies (NYU SPS) during the Summer of 2019. As such, it concentrates on the basics; avoiding heavy Javascript frameworks like JQuery.

# Project Requirements

Design and develop a web project on any subject you wish, providing that the content of the project includes dynamic DHTML effects/behavior, event handling, at least one form with form validation, and cookies or web storage. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine. Once the WEB service is running, it will serve all the static content that is needed.

```text
git clone https://github.com/peter-sattler/money-transfer-ui
cd money-transfer-ui
npm start
```

A separate REST API is also required.  Please follow that [project's](https://github.com/peter-sattler/money-transfer-api/blob/master/README.md) instructions for proper set-up

Once both back-end services are running, the application's home page will be available at http://localhost:3000 

## Personal Goal 

Write a fully interactive front-end to an existing Java REST service while still fulfilling the final project's _Sultan-ian_ requirements.

## Application Perspective

**RULE #1:** There is only one bank; _Pete's World Banking Empire_. Herein referred to as _The Empire_.

This application is intended to be used by internal employees of *The Empire* only. Both our branch representatives and our call center are required to use it or suffer the consequences. It includes internal reminders to apply pressure to the customer where required. After all, we are an evil empire.

Like any evil empire, our journey to world domination starts in _Toon Town_.

## Implementation Details

:moneybag: Implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript (including AJAX)  
:moneybag: Static content is served via an embedded Express web server (https://expressjs.com)  
:moneybag: The [JSON generator](https://next.json-generator.com) was used to create the initial test data  

## Assumptions / Limitations 

:moneybag: I did NOT strive for cross-browser compatibility (tested on Safari only).  
:moneybag: Customer images are available for pre-loaded data only.  
:moneybag: Bidirectional mapping of customer and account entities in the API layer forced the front-end to make two separate AJAX calls for customer data and for account data on the customer details page.   
:moneybag: REST service should assign account number. It should not be the responsibility of the front-end.  
:moneybag: REST service should not allow an account to be deleted unless it has a zero balance. Enforced this on the front-end.  
:moneybag: Account transfer page should have drop-down lists for source and target accounts.  
:moneybag: Used CSS for rollovers since my navigation bar is text only. Javascript rollovers didn't make sense to me.  
:moneybag: Used session based cookies since nothing about the application is persistent anyway.  
    
## Lessons Learned

:moneybag: A surprising number of Looney Toon characters are MALE (lawsuit pending).    
:moneybag: For the final project, always begin a Google search using the phrase _vanilla javascript_ or _vanilla js_.  
:moneybag: <ins>AJAX CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Issues</ins> - The port number of the web server (3000) and REST service (8080) are different, so Javascript doesnâ€™t consider them from the _same origin_. I had to add a CORS filter to the REST service in order to relax these restrictions.  
:moneybag: <ins>HTML 5 Input Types</ins> - Both the new input types (*tel*, *email* and *date*) and built-in pattern matching worked as advertised, but did not integrate well with my overall error handling mechanism.  

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Professor Sam Sultan (http://samsultan.com) for his humor, patience and knowledge of Javascript. You are an excellent instructor. It was a pleasure to be part of your class.
